Performance Summary:\n- Green day (+$26.86)\n- 7/9 trades profitable (77.8% win rate)\n- Modest but consistent gains\n- Best trade: +$7.65 SELL, Worst trade: -$2.25 BUY\n\n2. Key Observations:\n- Strong directional bias toward SELL signals\n- Concentrated trading between 03:00-10:30\n- Ensemble ML consistently predicting sell-side\n- Short-duration trades (mostly <1 hour)\n- Majority of signals blocked by trend filter\n\n3. Filter Effectiveness:\n- 35 total signals, 9 actual trades\n- 29/35 blocked by trend filter (uptrend)\n- Trend filter prevented potential counter-trend losses\n- No spread blocking occurred\n- Minimal volatility/cooldown interference\n\n4. Risk Management:\n- Tight position management\n- Partial profit taking at 1R\n- Small per-trade P/L (+/-$2-$7)\n- No significant drawdown observed\n- Conservative approach evident\n\n5. Actionable Insights:\n- Investigate persistent sell-side bias during uptrend\n- Consider adjusting trend filter sensitivity\n- Explore why ML ensemble consistently predicts sells\n- Potential to optimize entry/exit timing\n- Validate model's sell signals against broader market context\n\nRecommendation: Fine-tune trend filter and ML signal interpretation to capitalize on more trade opportunities while maintaining current risk profile.\n\n### XAUUSD -- $+0.00, 0 trades\nPERFORMANCE ANALYSIS: XAUUSD BOT (2026-02-15)\n\n1. Performance Summary:\nNO TRADE DAY. No actual trading occurred despite 64 total signals, all pointing SELL. This suggests extremely conservative filtering or significant underlying constraints preventing trade execution.\n\n2. Key Observations:\n- Consistent SELL signals with 70.91% model confidence\n- Repeated \"No trade signal\" outputs every minute\n- Asian session with elevated confidence threshold (55%)\n- Stable ATR (5.0) indicates consistent market volatility\n- Strong directional bias toward short/sell side\n\n3. Filter Analysis:\n- 0/64 signals passed all filters\n- No trades blocked by:\n  * Trend filter\n  * Spread filter\n  * Cooldown mechanism\n  * Volatility constraints\n- Suggests overly restrictive rule set or potential configuration issue\n\n4. Risk Management:\n- Extreme risk aversion preventing any trade execution\n- Model shows high sell-side conviction (70.9% vs 24.7% buy)\n- No observable position sizing or drawdown concerns due to zero trades\n\n5. Actionable Insights:\n- Review confidence thresholds (currently too strict)\n- Validate filter logic preventing trade execution\n- Potentially lower confidence requirement\n- Investigate why 70.91% confidence signals are universally rejected\n- Consider dynamic threshold adjustment during Asian session\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Audit filtering mechanisms. Current configuration prevents potentially profitable trades while showing clear directional market insight.\n\n### EURUSD -- $+0.00, 0 trades\nPERFORMANCE ANALYSIS - EURUSD BOT (2026-02-15)\n\n1. Performance Summary:\nNO TRADES DAY (Neutral/Red)\n- 34 total signals generated\n- 0 executed trades\n- 100% signals blocked by trend filter\n\n2. Key Observations:\n- Consistent BUY signals (71.09% confidence)\n- ALL signals blocked due to DOWNTREND\n- Asian session active, confidence threshold raised to 50%\n- ML model consistently generating BUY signals against market trend\n- EMA50/EMA200 both at 1.19, confirming downward bias\n\n3. Filter Effectiveness:\n- Trend Filter: 34/34 signals blocked (100%)\n- Spread Filter: 0 blocks\n- Volatility Filter: 0 blocks\n- TREND FILTER performing critical risk management role\n\n4. Risk Management:\n- Adaptive filters prevented potential losing trades\n- No exposure during contradictory market conditions\n- ML model showing potential bias/overfitting\n- ATR reporting as 0.0 (potential data issue)\n\n5. Actionable Insights:\n- Investigate ML model's consistent BUY bias\n- Review ML training data for trend alignment\n- Consider adding trend-concordant signal weighting\n- Validate ATR calculation mechanism\n- Potentially reduce confidence threshold during ranging markets\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Refine ML model's trend sensitivity and validate underlying data inputs.\n\n### POLYMARKET\n**Portfolio Summary**\n- Open positions: 7\n- Total invested: $86.91\n- Current value: $85.38\n- Unrealized P/L: $-1.54\n- Resolved: 2\n- Realized P/L: $-10.00\n- Initial deposit: $100.27\n- Wallet balance: $88.73\n\n**Sniper stats (this session):**\n- Trades placed: 0\n- Committed: $0 / $1 limit\n- Candidates found: 29\n\n**Open Positions:**\n- 0x60acc46cda1f0619259acf3ef8c77bf734ff08cbed256ca3 | YES | cost $1.28 | value $0.43 | P/L $-0.85\n- 0xe546672750517f62c45a5a00067481981e62b9c20fa82202 | YES | cost $3.72 | value $3.88 | P/L $+0.16\n- 0x61b66d02793b4a68ab0cc25be60d65f517fe18c7d6540412 | NO | cost $10.00 | value $8.97 | P/L $-1.03\n- 0x7ed08b305a3cca4f5b4e0c295c6b066e424a61358447b35d | NO | cost $5.00 | value $5.19 | P/L $+0.19\n- 89036168105179001192755120118050209760422683300339 | NO | cost $19.19 | value $19.19 | P/L $+0.00\n- 10255981703463102222150020864178492929573105385760 | YES | cost $23.73 | value $23.73 | P/L $+0.00\n- 11026322801311175672896646575033162055946443242177 | YES | cost $23.99 | value $23.99 | P/L $+0.00",
