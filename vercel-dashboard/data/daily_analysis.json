    "summary": "### BTCUSD -- $+26.86, 9 trades, 7W/2L (78% WR)\nPERFORMANCE ANALYSIS - BTCUSD BOT (2026-02-15)\n\n1. Performance Summary:\nGreen day overall. Total P/L: $26.86, with 7/9 trades profitable (77.8% win rate). Modest but positive performance indicates consistent strategy execution.\n\n2. Key Observations:\n- Strong directional bias toward LONG trades (6 BUY vs 3 SELL)\n- Tight trade management: partial profit at 1R, breakeven stop\n- Most trades clustered in morning hours (03:47 - 10:23)\n- Average trade profit: ~$3.00\n\n3. Filter Analysis:\n- Significant signal suppression: 35 total signals, only 9 executed\n- Trend filter most restrictive: 29 signals blocked due to uptrend\n- Volatility & cooldown minimally impactful (1 block each)\n- Trend filter likely prevented potential losing trades\n\n4. Risk Management:\n- Conservative approach with multiple filtering layers\n- Small position sizes (max drawdown <$3)\n- Adaptive cooldown mechanism functioning\n- No catastrophic losses detected\n\n5. Actionable Insights:\n- Investigate why ensemble model generates many blocked SELL signals during uptrend\n- Consider dynamic trend threshold adjustment\n- Explore why morning trades clustered\n- Potential machine learning model recalibration to reduce over-signaling\n- Add asymmetric position sizing for higher confidence trades\n\nRecommendation: Minor tuning needed. Strategy fundamentally sound with disciplined risk management.\n\n### XAUUSD -- $+0.00, 0 trades\n**Performance Summary**:\nNeutral/No Trade Day. Zero executed trades despite 64 total signals, all sell-oriented. This suggests extreme caution or potential configuration issues.\n\n**Key Observations**:\n- Consistent SELL signals with 70.91% confidence\n- Recurring pattern: Asian session with elevated confidence threshold (55%)\n- Uniform signal characteristics across multiple 1-minute intervals\n- No directional diversity (0 buy signals, 64 sell signals)\n- Consistent ATR of 5.0 suggests stable market volatility\n\n**Filter Analysis**:\n- No signals blocked by trend, spread, cooldown, or volatility filters\n- Implies filters are either too permissive or signals are genuinely suppressed\n- High signal rejection suggests over-conservative risk management\n\n**Risk Management**:\n- No trades executed prevents potential losses\n- Consistent signal rejection indicates robust pre-trade screening\n- Potential missed opportunity cost if signals are valid\n\n**Actionable Insights**:\n1. Investigate why ALL signals are sell-side\n2. Review ML model calibration, potential bias in training data\n3. Assess confidence threshold - might be unnecessarily restrictive\n4. Check for potential technical issues preventing trade execution\n5. Consider lowering confidence requirement or introducing more nuanced filtering\n6. Verify ensemble ML model's current performance and recalibration needs\n\nRecommendation: Conduct a comprehensive model review and validate signal generation logic. The current configuration appears overly conservative and may be missing valid trading opportunities.\n\n### EURUSD -- $+0.00, 0 trades\nANALYSIS REPORT: EURUSD BOT (2026-02-15)\n\n1. PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:\n- NO TRADES EXECUTED\n- Technically a neutral/flat day\n- Zero realized P/L\n\n2. KEY OBSERVATIONS:\n- Consistent downtrend detected (EMA50 < EMA200)\n- Persistent BUY signals (71.09% confidence)\n- Asian session triggered higher confidence threshold (50%)\n- Machine learning models consistently generating buy probabilities\n- Trend filter systematically blocking all signals\n\n3. FILTER ANALYSIS:\n- Total Signals: 34\n- Trend-Blocked Signals: 34 (100% blocked)\n- Spread/Volatility Filters: No additional blocking\n- Trend filter working effectively, preventing counter-trend trades\n\n4. RISK MANAGEMENT:\n- Positive: Strict trend filter preventing potential loss-making trades\n- Potential Concern: Consistent buy signals during downtrend suggest model recalibration might be needed\n- No visible risk of drawdown due to trade prevention\n\n5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS:\n- Evaluate ML model's buy signal generation during clear downtrend\n- Consider adding directional confirmation mechanisms\n- Implement secondary trend confirmation (e.g., momentum indicators)\n- Review machine learning model's training data for potential bias\n- Potentially reduce confidence threshold or add more nuanced trend detection\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Minor model tuning required. Current risk management is conservative but may be overly restrictive.",
